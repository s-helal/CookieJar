        Welcome to the Ocular Vision Acuity Test for Audio-Response Users (can
        listen and respond verbally to commands)
      </p>
      <p>
        Before you begin, please
        <strong> stand 3 ft away from the screen</strong> for a more accurate
        vision score
      </p>
      <p>
        Place your device on a level surface where the chart on the screen is
        directly in your line of vision.

        Close one eye and cover it with your palm. Your other eye will be tested
        for visual acuity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have finished testing that eye, you may switch eyes and repeat
        the test again for the other eye.
      </p>
      <p>
        Click the button "Start Listening" below to begin speaking the letters
        you can see on the screen.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you are finished, say "Stop" or click "Stop Listening"
      </p>
